# BahnVision Docs Overview

This directory centralises project documentation so engineering, product, and ops references stay aligned.

- `architecture/` – technical specifications, schema reviews, and diagrams describing the FastAPI backend.
- `product/` – product requirements, personas, and scope/vision material for the BahnVision experience.
- `operations/` – (reserved) deployment guides, alerting playbooks, and runbooks as they are produced.
- `archive/` – historical documents kept for context (e.g. the original AI-first design vision and legacy TODO lists).

Each subdirectory should own its README or index as content grows; cross-link updates belong in PR descriptions when docs move.
