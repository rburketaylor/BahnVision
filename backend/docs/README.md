# BahnVision Docs Overview

This directory centralises backend documentation. Start with the canonical tech spec in `docs/tech-spec.md`.

- `archive/` — historical backend docs (design doc, persistence branch plan, legacy tech spec). Use for context only.

No live architecture/product/operations subfolders live here today; add new backend-specific docs alongside this README and cross-link from `docs/tech-spec.md` when created.

Each subdirectory should own its README or index as content grows; cross-link updates belong in PR descriptions when docs move.
