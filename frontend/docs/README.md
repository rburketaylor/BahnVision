# BahnVision Frontend Docs Hub

Frontend documentation now mirrors the backend structure so architecture, product, and delivery notes stay organised. Start with the canonical backend tech spec in `docs/tech-spec.md`.

- `architecture/` – stack overview, API integration contract, ADRs, and implementation summary.
- `product/` – UX flows, personas, and design intent that guide feature work.
- `operations/` – testing strategy, observability plans, and future runbooks.
- `roadmap/` – milestone plans, delivery timelines, and actionable implementation checklists.
- `archive/` – (reserved) historical docs that are no longer authoritative.

Update these sections as the frontend evolves so implementation stays aligned with backend capabilities in `docs/tech-spec.md`.
