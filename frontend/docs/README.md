# BahnVision Frontend Docs Hub

Start with the canonical tech spec in `docs/tech-spec.md`; this folder tracks frontend-specific plans and references.

- `product/` – UX flows and design intent (map overlays and analytics notes are aspirational).
- `operations/` – testing strategy (current) and observability plan (planned).
- `roadmap/` – delivery plans and backlog; several documents are aspirational, see status notes inside.
- `archive/` – historical ADRs/overviews kept for context.

Update these sections as the frontend evolves so implementation stays aligned with backend capabilities in `docs/tech-spec.md`.
